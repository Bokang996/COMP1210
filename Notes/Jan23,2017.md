### Notes: Data and expressions

### Strings maybe?
did not take notes.
### Escape Sequences
For example to print a quotation mark "  use a '\' 
this is called and escape sequence
some other escape sequences are....

| Escape Sequence | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
|`\t`|tab|
|`\n`|Newline|
|`\r`|carriage return|
|`\"`| print double quote|
|`\'`| print single quote|
|`\\`| print backslash|

In Windows `\r\n` are used together by *println* and *enter* to move to the next line; in Mac OS, Linux, Unix, only `\n`

see: _**EsacpeSeq.java**_


### Primitive Data
8 types of *"variables"* or Preimitive data types in java
- integer
	- byte
	- short
	- *int*				`int age = 19;`
	- long
- Floating Point
	- float
	- *double*			`double avg = 94.8';`
- character
	- char				`char letter = 'A';`
- Boolean
	- boolean			`boolean isCold = false;`

see: _**VariablesExample.java**_
 

### Expressions
arthmetic expressions compute numberic results making use of the operators:

| Operations | Symbol |
|----------|----------|
| Addition | `+` |
| Subtraction | `-` |
| Multiplication|`*`|
| Division |`/`|
| Remainder (Modulus) |`%`|

the *increment* operator `++` adds one to the operand
the *decrement* operator `--` subtracts one to the operand

`count++;` is equal to `count = count + 1;`
