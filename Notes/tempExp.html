So for this project we are tasked with replacing ArrayList with Arrays. the only two classes that we will edit from project 6 are DodeacahedronList and DodecahedronListMenuApp.
first you need to rename the classes to DodeacahedronList2 and DodecahedronList2MenuApp. then you need to change the names of all of the thinks that reference the class from project 6. I found the best way to do this is to compile it as is with the class name changes and look at the compile errors. after you fix the most of the compile time errors you need to start changing the ArrayList variables to Arrays. this is not all to hard because the syntax for arrays is fairly simple.

for example I changed the ArrayList at the begining of the DodecahedronList2.java
 
ArrayList &lt;Dodecahedron&gt; dodObjList;
to
Dodecahedron[] dodObjList;

continue this until you change all of the ArrayList objects to Arrays, then compile it.
