## Welcome to COMP 1210!

### your guide to surviving Java.

All the notes taken and in the site assume you have no programming knowledge and no experence with Java.
pdfs are also available from my class as well as some notes that I took in Markdown.

The website will have more indepth explinations and looks at the code though the course so be sure to check the website for that!
